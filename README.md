# ScioniAaudiospeakerupgrade
This is a guide for 2016 Scion iA and 2017 Toyota Matrix iA (and I believe Mazda 2) audio speaker upgrade. It describes the process of locating the speakers and the specifications for the speakers.


## Speaker Specification Requirements

It was difficult to find the exact size of the stock audio speakers. I took a chance and just bought what Crutchfield suggested (not knowing if they themselves look at a Scion iA or just based it off a Mazda 2 or similar car).

Both the front doors and rear doors have a 2-way 6.5" speaker with 4-ohm impedence.
The stock speakers are rated at 25 Watts (not sure if that is RMS or peak). So basically anything on Crutchfield is an upgrade. Material is very hard, small coil, weak magnet, etc. See the image included.

## Reaching Speaker Location
There are two philips-head screws that hold the door panel.
1. Door handle
2. Window control arm

Start with the door handle. Open the door handle and with a skinny flat-head screw driver, remove the plastic cover.

Next, lift the window door controls. You may need a flat-head against the sides. There is also some space you can wedge at the bottom but it has poor leverage.

Remove the window control cables (2). This is what it looks like removed:

Remove the black flat thingy on the side of the door:

Now you can pop open the door panel. You should rotate it a bit and let it rest on something while you work on your speaker upgrade. I kept the door handle cable and wiring attached because I am too lazy to remove entirely. If the cable disconnects, you can simply reattach it.

## Speaker Upgrade
Remove the speaker connector. Note: I didn't research the speaker polarity wiring. I played it by ear. Don't do what I do.
It is probably best to just rip out the old speaker and use the original brackets. Crutchfield usually sends you brackets but they require a drill bit to fit. I just used 3-4 of the black screws onto the original bracket.
