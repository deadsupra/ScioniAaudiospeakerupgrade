# ScioniAaudiospeakerupgrade
This is a guide for 2016 Scion iA and 2017 Toyota Matrix iA (and I believe Mazda 2) audio speaker upgrade. It describes the process of locating the speakers and the specifications for the speakers.


## Speaker Specification Requirements

It was difficult to find the exact size of the stock audio speakers. I took a chance and just bought what Crutchfield suggested (not knowing if they themselves look at a Scion iA or just based it off a Mazda 2 or similar car).

Both the front doors and rear doors have a 2-way 6.5" speaker with 4-ohm impedence.
The stock speakers are rated at 25 Watts (not sure if that is RMS or peak). So basically anything on Crutchfield is an upgrade. Material is very hard, small coil, weak magnet, etc. See the image included.

## Reaching Speaker Location
There are two philips-head screws that hold the door panel.
1. Door handle
2. Window control arm

Start with the door handle. Open the door handle and with a skinny flat-head screw driver, remove the plastic cover.

Next, lift the window door controls. You may need a flat-head against the sides. There is also some space you can wedge at the bottom but it has poor leverage.

Remove the window control cables (2). This is what it looks like removed:

Remove the black flat thingy on the side of the door:

Now you can pop open the door panel. You should rotate it a bit and let it rest on something while you work on your speaker upgrade. I kept the door handle cable and wiring attached because I am too lazy to remove entirely. If the cable disconnects, you can simply reattach it.

## Speaker Upgrade
Remove the speaker connector. **Note**: I didn't research the speaker polarity wiring. I played it by ear. Don't do what I do.

It is probably best to just rip out the old speaker and use the original brackets. Crutchfield usually sends you brackets but they require a drill bit to fit. I just used 3-4 of the black screws onto the original bracket.

If you choose to reuse the original bracket, pierce the original's paper cone and remove it. To remove the magnet and coil, you will need to clip off the positive and negative wires (leave some extra from the bracket's end just in case). Remove the plastic structure supporting the coil and magnet (the new speakers won't fit without removing it). You can use strong scissors, pliers, or anything as long as you don't damage the outer part of the bracket. Drill or screw the new speaker over the original bracket.

## Wiring
Now you have to connect the positive and negative terminals. Usually new speakers come with wires with connectors on one end and solder wire ends on the other. You should solder the wires to the original terminals. However, if you are lazy like me or don't have a soldering iron, simply twist the old wires from the bracket's terminals to the new connector's ends. Make sure that the positive and negative wires don't come in contact, ever.
*Sorry didn't take pictures of this process*

Put the door panel back on (punch it back into place if needed).

### Test your system
If you hear both speakers, so far so good. If you hear both but one side sounds better like the sound waves are pushing against your ear but the other side sounds like it is lacking the same pressure, you most likely have bad wiring polarity.

You can use a simple phone app to generate a sound wave and analyze it. Just be mindful of background noise. For this reason, it is best to test either the front pair or back pair separately.
